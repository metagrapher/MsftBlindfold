Originally "Post installation scripts for [Udoo Bolt](https://www.udoo.org/udoo-bolt/) based gaming machine."

However, upon reading the ps1 file the mad genius [amigarulez](https://github.com/amigarulez) wrote, I realized that, sure, it could do post-install scripty stuff, but that's an understatement of what this does. This script will de-telemetry your Windows! Window Blinds, if you will. Damn. I should have named it that. I might still change it.

ANYWHo. Take this script as you will... I strongly recommend you read the .ps1 file and see for yourself what it's doing, and likely modify it from there to suit your tastes. As this is my initial fork of the original repo, I will be adding my own notes as I come around to it. For now, take it as it is: Awesome.
